movie is often quotable to those that have seen it and it is no surprise that this film affected pop culture to a certain degree There was a time where it got a lot of dough and was a hit which in

picture but still to this day it still remains as a remarkable film Is there anything that has not been said about The Godfather Probably not but that is not going to stop me from sharing my thoughts regarding Francis Ford Coppola s masterpiece The Godfather is a tale of a New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son which carries a heavy weight This film often gets praised for its acting and that s no surprise there Even though The Godfather ended up as a trilogy Most of the cast may have left a huge impression in the second Godfather film but the first movie still has terrific acting throughout the entire film Marlon Brando s performance as Don Corelone is very likely and arguably his best role in his film career Even though the late Marlon Brando was a well respected actor before and since The Godfather He was not the only reason that The Godfather is a great film The casting is a rather interesting one since it contains actors that either have been around for a number of years or actors that are quite new but had a couple roles James Caan plays a hot tempered Sonny Robert Duvall has a great voice of reason in playing Tom Hagen Diane Keaton plays her supporting role quite fittingly as Kay Adams and Al Pacino s performance really makes Michael Corleone an intriguing character in the film and that carries on in the later films The entire performance of every cast member feels natural even if there were a number of takes shot in the movie Some may say that this movie has some of the greatest acting in the history of cinema but I think that would be a bit of a stretch to make that claim The entire cast makes all the characters believable and realistic in their portrayal The Godfather might not be the most realistic portrayal of the Mafia but it is certainly the most romanticized Mafia movie However there are some realistic moments which is the brutality that The Godfather portrays and Khartoum was the first example of this film s brutality I also don t think that the brutality is a way of glorifying violence in the film it is first and foremost a cinematic portrait of the Mafia and it also serves as a thought provoking character study which carries on in the later films It may be a romanticized portrait of the Mafia and it may be a bit realistic in its brutal moments but it doesn t feel out of place Considering the film is set in the 1940 s with the notion that it is a romaticized portrayal of the Mafia there s a theme of moral ambiguity that allows the viewer to think and question about the character inside the movie I find it strange that outside of the movie it is possible that a viewer and myself if I may add finds the moral ambiguity fascinating in The Godfather It carries on in the story that is told in the film One of the fitting touches is the music by Nino Rota and it s a bit predictable that it has that Italian sound but it is extremely fitting to the film Like the film itself Nino Rota s Film score to The Godfather is highly regarded as one of the greatest film scores in cinema I can say it s hard not to like It definitely has the Italian feeling and it compliments the movie perfectly I should add an interesting additional note that Carmine Coppola the father of Francis Ford Coppola did compose some of the additional music I find this kind of interesting considering that the Father and Son relationship between Michael and Vito was intriguely written If that isn t interesting enough Francis Ford Coppola put his daughter Sofia in the movie too with a cameo appearance as a baby boy Some members of the family may have been involved in this movie and even the later Godfather films but family also plays a theme in The Godfather Another nice element that gives the film its elegance is Gordon Willis cinematography The film is shot well the movie looks like it is in the 1940 s The cars you will see in the movie were cars made in the 1940 s and this movie was only made in 1972 so it wasn t too difficult to find vehicles like that The design is fitting for this film because of its setting Overall The entire movie is shot extremely well Even though this is an adaptation of Mario Puzo s novel of the same name published in 1969 Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola did write the screenplay and regardless if the movie faithfully follows the book from the first page to the last Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are contempt with the changes that are there from Book to Movie Even though The Godfather is a considered one of the greatest movies ever made I was very close in rating this film a 10 out of 10 but I noticed a couple hiccups in the film even though they are small errors they are not influencing me to change my mind that I find The Godfather to be a terrific film those who saw the movie at face value can unanimously agree that The Godfather is a great film My philosophy of The 10 rating is that it is as great as it is ever going to get They are not perfect because of a rating like that There could be some mistakes and some miniscule flaws that can be found but are excused Even if that were the case they don t ruin the movie whatsoever There really is no such thing as a perfect movie Francis Ford Coppola pulled the strings with the terrific acting excellent cinematography fitting music believable characters and an intriguing plot It is not only one of Francis Ford Coppola s masterpieces it is one of the masterpieces in cinema This film gets my Thumbs Up it s a 5 star film My overall rating of The Godfather is a 9 9 out of 10 it is an excellent film Expand","2014-07-24",2014

money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him andInspired by the Five Families of New York City The Godfather tells the story of how the Corleones are pushed against the wall by their rivals and other upcoming gangsters who want to make money by sources Don Vito deems beneath him and their retaliation and its consequences Alliances are formed in secret murders are plotted enemies are butchered or blown to pieces without remorse Don Vito Marlon Brando and his sons Sonny James Caan and Michael Al Pacino are the main characters The actors bringing them to life have succeeded in their jobs so supremely that these characters have become the stuff of legend Don Vito s backstory from the novel was pushed into The Godfather Part II and that was a practical decision as the movie was already three hours long Sonny and Michael display their acumen for running criminal activities when the reins are handed to them in their turn Tom Hagen Robert Duvall is the consigliere or the most trusted adviser of the Don We are transported from 1940s NYC ripe with Mafia bosses one upping each other to Sicily and Las Vegas The characters are never shown to traverse great expanses of land or sea in search of destiny or whatever Neither are they shown to be engaging in life or death situations where they have to come out on top using their wits or physical strength or endurance But the change of settings does meet the requirements of the epic genre Even though we don t get to see large scale gunfights or something like that the fact that the Corleones are in all these places helps to form that opinion The story is essentially about a single family and you get the impression that the message here is that family is important and that the lengths you re willing to go to to protect them knows no bounds The Corleones peace is fazed when a gangster offers them a deal in drugs Don Vito expresses his disgust and refuses This triggers an unexpected ploy for gaining power and upper hand and turns the conflict into a fully fledged gang war Some characters are displaced forced to take up arms or caught in the crossfire Another calamity strikes when things seem to have cooled down Finally the Corleones deal with their enemies effectively and ruthlessly The victory is theirs but if it is worth it is for the audience to decide The Godfather s success lies in its rich story and characters Often times great stories come about by accident The setting complements the plot and the characters and becoming a character itself creates a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts These characters and plot could quite easily have worked in a medieval setting of dynasties warring for control over a kingdom or any other setting for that matter but the fact that the setting was New York City and the control over the city meant control over the most lucrative criminal activities which is a decadent scheme and immediately paints even the good guys in a bad light was what in my opinion made The Godfather much more intriguing and enduring There are many enemies to deal with The film doesn t develop them at all The Corleones are the only ones who are explored and developed as characters At first it seems like it is a story of a group of people who have virtually everything they could ever want and the film would only chronicle their exploits as they vanquish this enemy and that This changes as we move forward and witness the bloodshed No good movie can come into being without good plotting believable characterization classy cinematography and memorable dialogue and here it is all brought together nigh perfectly The production design was impressive The houses and their interiors and the cars and costumes were fascinating and left me with a desire to be able to witness that world firsthand The secondary characters may not have seemed to be given much screen time to develop them but the cast is so huge that if they had done it the movie would have been at least an hour longer The score is so simple and true to the story that you don t need me to tell you that it may be the most memorable score ever A lot of time is spent in contemplation and silence as the characters decide what the best course of action should be in response to a particular problem The dialogue fleshes out the characters very well The Godfather is essentially a film that looks into the lives of the gangsters at the top of the hierarchy We only see the comings and goings and not the handiwork of the men who carry out the orders of their bosses No shootouts during the gang war are shown The intrigue that directly affects the main characters is in itself so destructive and deadly that not once the exclusion of the ordinary mobsters bother me in any way The Godfather cannot be dismissed as being merely about a mob family and a bunch of criminals Given his later career I think it s safe to venture that Coppola was born to make this movie Expand","2014-03-06",2014
